# Machine Learning based Crop Yield Prediction

Agriculture, with its allied sectors, is the largest source of livelihoods and has the largest contribution in the GDP of our country. Yet, farmers are not getting enough price value of the crops. It happens mostly due to inappropriate crop selection, improper irrigation or at times the yield of crop is less than expected. A steady crop yield throughout longer periods is not possible due to affecting factors such as soil fertility, availability of water, climate and diseases or pests. By analyzing the soil and atmosphere at particular region best crop in order to have more crop yield and the net crop yield can be predicted. Knowing the possible yield of a crop based on these factors beforehand can help decide the potential and in turn profitability of that crop. For this purpose, machine learning algorithms can be used which can train a model and make predictions as the output. In particular, Random Forest Algorithm is used in this project.
